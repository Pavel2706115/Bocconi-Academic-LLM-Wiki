## **From point estimate to interval estimate [READING]** 

The uncertainty associated with a point estimate is due to the sampling variability, i.e. to the different results that can be obtained based on the different samples that can be drawn from a population. This uncertainty can be quantified by the standard error of the estimator, and also depends on its distribution. 

The idea behind confidence intervals is to build an estimator that **explicitly incorporates** this uncertainty. 

In many **cases,** and specifically in **all the cases that we will take into account** , the interval an estimator can be obtained by adding and subtracting from an (appropriate) **point estimator** amount called the **margin of error (ME)** , which in turn depends on the **standard error** and on the **distribution of** the estimator

## **From point estimate to interval estimate [READING]** 

Consider the case where one wants to estimate the mean, **μ** , of a **population** 𝑿 

Population distribution ?

**Parameter (unknown): μ** 

Distribution of the estimator, here the 𝑿 . sample mean,[ഥ] 

Estimates obtained based on different samples (realisations of 𝑿[ഥ] ): typically different from the parameter, even when they are concentrated around it with high probability! 

The estimated interval is built around the point estimate, taking into account the dispersion of the estimates around the parameter!

## **Confidence interval: general concepts [READING]** 

Building a confidence interval 

Point estimator ± Margin of error 

Point Estimator ± (Reliability Factor)(Standard Error) 

- The  **reliability factor** depends on the **required confidence level** , (1 - ), and on the 

- **distribution of** the point estimator, and – given the standard error – controls (determines) the width of the interval. 

-  

- If the confidence level (1 – ) is high, i.e. if the probability that the interval (estimator) contains the parameter of interest is high, the width of the interval will be larger. 

   - 

   - Indeed, the interval (  ;  ) contains the parameter with probability 1, while a point estimator will cover the parameter with probability 0 (if the point estimator is a continuous r.v.). 

   - There is therefore a **trade-off** between the precision of the interval (the greater the smaller the interval width) and the confidence level. 

**5** 

## **The confidence level [READING]** 

The confidence level  **(1 –** ) 

- Probability that the **random** confidence interval contains the unknown parameter 

- It can also be seen as the **proportion** of samples (out of all those that can be drawn from the population) leading to interval **estimates** containing the parameter. 

 The interval estimate built based on a **specific** sample may or may not contain the parameter (and it is not possible to state which of the two situations occurs, because the parameter is unknown). Thus, **it makes no sense to associate any probability with the actual interval estimate**

For each possible sample, an interval is obtained based on an appropriately chosen statistic (estimator) 

 The (1 - )x100% of the intervals (estimates) contains the parameter  The ( )x100% of the intervals do not contain the parameter 

## Interval Estimates 

For a specific interval (calculated from one specific sample) **we cannot know whether or not**  **contain the it contains the parameter. However, if we know that** (1 – )x100% of intervals  _**level**_ that the observed interval is one of those **parameter, we can be** _**confident at the**_ (1 – ) including the parameter **!**

## **Confidence interval for μ :** 𝛔 **[2] known** 

**Interval estimation of the mean, μ, of a population** 𝑿 **with known variance,** 𝛔[𝟐] **.** Case where 𝑿 is normal or the sample is large enough (central limit theorem). Given any value of 𝛂 it is:

𝛔 𝑿 𝒛 **The interval is obtained by subtracting and adding to**[ഥ] **the margin of error ME=** 𝛂/𝟐 𝒏[, ] given by the product between the **reliability factor** , 𝒛 (depending on the distribution of the 𝛂/𝟐 (standardised) estimator and on the confidence level), and the **standard error** of 𝑿[ഥ] . 

**10** 

## **Rstudio: CI.mean()** 

The function **`CI.mean()`** in package **`UBStats`** allows to determine the confidence interval for the expected value of a population: 

```
CI.mean(x, sigma=NULL, conf.level=0.95, digits=2, data)
```

## where: 

- **`x`** is a **numeric** vector or the name of one of the columns of the dataframe specified in **`data`** 

- **`sigma`** is the value of the standard deviation, **if known** 

- **`conf_level`** is the confidence level (0.95 by default) 

- **`digits`** is the number of decimals used to round off the reported statistics 

**11** 

## **Hands on: estimation of μ with** 𝛔 **[2] known** 

To assess the efficiency of a call centre, a survey is conducted on a random sample of **300** calls received in one week (dataframe **`CallCenter.P`** in **`Lesson 14-16_Data.Rdata`** ) for which, among other things, information on the duration (in seconds) of the conversation ( **`TimeTalk`** ) is collected. It is **assumed** that the conversation duration has a standard deviation = 150 sec. **Determine the 99% confidence interval for the average conversation duration.** 

```
library(UBStats)
CI.mean(x=TimeTalk,sigma=150,conf.level = 0.99,data=CallCenter.P)
```

**`> CI.mean(x=TimeTalk,sigma=150,conf.level = 0.99,data=CallCenter.P) Confidence interval for the mean Confidence level: 0.99`** _[Note that the function can also be used to_ **`Variance: known`**

## **Hands on: estimation of μ with** 𝛔 **[2] known** 

To assess the efficiency of a call centre, a survey is conducted on a random sample of **300** calls received in one week (dataframe **`CallCenter.P`** in **`Lesson 14-16_Data.Rdata`** ) for which, among other things, information on the duration (in seconds) of the conversation ( **`TimeTalk`** ) is collected.

```

**Can we conclude that the average talk time is between 232.07 and 276.68 with probability 0.99?** 

No, because the observed interval **is not random,** so it either contains **μ** or it does not. We can, however, say that 99% of the intervals built around the sample mean contain **μ** ; hence we can quantify the confidence level (or trust) associated with the interval as 99%, defined as the % of interval estimates that contain the parameter. 

**13** 

## **Hands on: estimation of μ with** 𝛔 **[2] known / CI width** 

**How to obtain a 99% confidence interval for the average conversation time with width 20?** The length of the confidence interval for the mean in the case of known variance is **2ME= 2** 𝒛 𝒏 𝛔/ 𝛂/𝟐 

Given the confidence level and the variance of the population, the only quantity on which one can act to reduce the width of the interval is the sample size. For the width of the interval to be 20, it is necessary that **ME=10** , i.e. that: 

**==> picture [258 x 67] intentionally omitted <==**

- **`# sample size needed to obtain ci of width 10`** 

- **`z_alpha_2 <- qnorm(0.995)`** 

- **`z_alpha_2`** 

- **`[1] 2.575829`** 

- **`(z_alpha_2*150/10)^2`** _A sample of size higher than or equal to_ _**1493** should be drawn._ 

- **`[1] 1492.852`** 

**14** 

## **Confidence interval for μ :** 𝛔 **[2] known / CI width** 

𝛂 **Determination of the sample size needed to guarantee a CI at level 1 – with a given margin of error, ME (or, equivalently, with a given width, 2ME).** 

For the margin of error to be at **most ME (or, equivalently, for the interval width to be at most 2ME),** it is necessary to select a sample with size:

Clearly, the result should be rounded up to the next integer! 

This result holds even when the distribution is not normal, as **long as the resulting size is big enough to ensure the applicability of the central limit theorem (otherwise the distribution of the sample mean would not be normal)** 

**15** 

## **Confidence interval for μ (pop. Normal):** 𝛔 **[2] not known** 

**Interval estimation of the mean, μ, of a normally distributed population** 𝑿 **with variance** 𝛔[𝟐] **unknown** 

The confidence interval for  **μ** at level (1 – )x100% is: 

**==> picture [234 x 54] intentionally omitted <==**

**Since the variance is unknown, the extremes of the interval are not known!!!** It would seem natural to **substitute to** 𝛔 **its estimate** , based on the sample variance , 𝑺= 𝑺[𝟐] However, **the distribution of** 𝑿[ഥ] when replacing 𝑺 to 𝛔 **is no longer normal (and therefore the percentile used,** 𝒛 **, is not appropriate here)** ! 𝛂/𝟐 The following result is valid, yet: if the population has a **normal** distribution **,** the statistic 

𝑿−ഥ 𝛍 𝑻 **=** 𝒏 𝑺/ 

has a known distribution, specifically a _**Student’s t**_ distribution with ( 𝒏 – 1) **degrees of freedom, denoted by** _**t**_ 𝒏 –1 

**16** 

## **Student’s** _**t**_ **distribution** 

Replacing  **[2]** with the sample variance, 𝑺[𝟐] , increases the uncertainty that characterises 𝑿[ഥ] , since also 𝑺[𝟐] varies from sample to sample. The _**Student's t**_ distribution is bell-shaped and centred at **0,** and depends on a single parameter, 𝜈 , called **degrees of freedom** , which influences its variability **As the degrees of freedom increase,** _**Student’s t**_ **converges to the standard normal**

## **Confidence interval for μ (pop. Normal):** 𝛔 **[2] not known** 

**Interval estimate for the mean, μ, of a normally distributed population with variance,** 𝛔[𝟐] **, unknown** Following the same procedure as in the case where the variance is known and the distribution of the standardised sample mean is a standard normal, when the population distribution is normal and the variance unknown, the confidence interval for **μ** at the (1 – )x100% level is: 

**==> picture [481 x 54] intentionally omitted <==**

**The interval is obtained by subtracting and adding to the point estimator,** 𝑿[ഥ] **, the margin of** 𝒔 **error ME=** 𝒕 𝒏−𝟏,𝛂/𝟐 𝒏[, given by the product between the ] **[reliability factor]**[, ][𝒕][𝒏−𝟏,𝛂/𝟐] **[–]**[ which ] depends on the distribution of the estimator (standardised using the square root of the sample **–** variance) and on the confidence level and the **estimate of the standard error** of 𝑿[ഥ] . 

* We use the notation of the book indicating with the percentile of order (1 – /2) 

**18** 

## **Rstudio: CI.mean(), pt(), qt()** 

The function **`CI.mean()`** in package **`UBStats`** allows to determine the confidence interval for the expected value even when the variance is unknown. The syntax is as seen for the case with known variance, except that the argument **`sigma`** should not be specified. 

```
CI.mean(x, conf.level=0.95, digits=2, data)
```

It is also worth introducing the functions available in R to determine the **cumulative probabilities** and the **percentiles** of a Student’s _**t**_ distribution: 

## **`pt(q, df)`** and **`qt(p, df)`** 

similar to the functions **`pnorm()`** and **`qnorm()`** calculating probabilities and percentiles of a normal distribution, where: 

- **`df`** : degrees of freedom 

- **`q`** : (numerical) value at which the cumulative probability has to be calculated. The function **`pt()`** calculates 𝐹 **`q`** = Prob(𝒕𝐝𝐟 ≤ **`q`** ) (i.e. the area below the density curve of the Student’s _**t**_ distribution up to **`q`** ) 

- **`p:`** order of the **percentile** . The **`qt()`** function calculates the value at which the cumulative probability is **`p`** , i.e. the value 𝑡 **`df,1- p`** such that 𝐹 𝑡 **`df,1−p`** = Prob 𝒕df ≤ 𝑡 **`df,1−p`** = **`p`** .

𝒏 **? Is it possible to control the width of the confidence interval acting on** Both 𝑡 and 𝒔 and on 𝒏 _**.**_ depend on the **extracted sample** It is therefore not possible to 𝑛−1,α/2 guarantee that an interval will have a specific width, because that will depend on the sample that will be actually extracted and on the resulting variance estimate, which might differ from the actual one. An result can be obtained the same 𝒏 approximate using percentile (as increases, the percentile decreases) and the current estimate 𝒔 , which may, however, differ greatly from that estimated from another sample of bigger size.

## **Confidence interval for μ (non-normal pop.):** 𝛔 **[2] not known** 

**Suppose it is not possible to assume that the distribution is normal. Is it possible to obtain confidence intervals for μ in the case when the variance is unknown?** 

- If 𝒏 𝑿 is big enough, for the central limit theorem,[ഥ] has an approximately normal distribution. 

- However, the interval 

𝒄𝒊 ഥ𝒙∓𝒛 𝒏 𝟏−𝛂 𝛍= 𝛂/𝟐𝛔/ 

cannot be used because its extremes depend on 𝛔 , which is not known 

- However, the sample variance 𝑺[𝟐] is an unbiased estimator for 𝛔[𝟐] , and it can be shown that its variance decreases as 𝒏 increases; thus, when the sample is sufficiently large, variance estimates are concentrated around 𝛔[𝟐] . 

In the case of large samples, one can then substitute 𝒔 to 𝛔 to obtain the interval. 𝛔[𝟐] Statistical software usually build the interval as in the case of a normal population with unknown, thus using the percentile of the Student’s distribution, 𝑡 , which is higher than 𝑛−1,α/2 𝒛 , in order to take into account the greater uncertainty due to the substitution of 𝛔[𝟐] with its 𝛂/𝟐 𝒏 estimate (the two percentiles are however similar when is high):

## **Interval estimation** 

**Confidence intervals for the proportion** 

## **Confidence interval for the proportion** 

When one is interested in estimating the proportion, 𝒑 , of cases with a certain characteristic in the population, the confidence interval can be built based on the sample proportion, 𝑷[෡] , i.e. the sample mean of Bernoullian r.v.’s indicating success or failure for the sample units. 𝒏 **When the sample size, , is sufficiently large** , by the central limit theorem: 

**==> picture [530 x 204] intentionally omitted <==**

The variance of 𝑷[෡] depends on 𝒑 but, as in the case of a non-normal population with unknown variance, one can estimate the variance by substituting 𝒑 with the sample proportion, getting: 

. **Note that the percentile of the standardised normal distribution is used here** 

**25** 

## **Rstudio: CI.prop()** 

The function **`CI.prop()`** in package **`UBStats`** allows to determine the confidence interval for the proportion of 'successes' in a population. The syntax is very similar to that of function **`CI.mean()`** 

```
CI.prop(x, success=NULL, conf.level=0.95, digits=2, data)
```

## where: 

- **`x`** : name of a vector or factor or one of the columns of the dataframe specified in **`data`** 

- **`success x`** is to be considered a success. It can be omitted if : allows you to define which value of 

- **`x`** is a binary vector (values 0/1; in this case it is assumed that 1 indicates a success) or a logical 

- vector (values **`TRUE/FALSE`** ; in this case it is assumed that **`TRUE`** indicates a success) 

- **`conf_level`** is the confidence level (0.95 by default) 

- **`digits`** is the number of decimals used to round off the reported statistics 

Note that the function does not check whether the conditions needed to build the interval (e.g. sample width) are satisfied

# **Is it possible to obtain a 90% confidence interval with width at most 0.05 for the proportion of phone calls lasting more than 6 minutes?** 

We want to obtain an interval with semi-width ME=0.025; using a conservative approach we choose 𝒏 such that: 

𝟐 𝒛 **0.5**[𝟐] **0.5**[𝟐] 𝛂/𝟐 𝒛 ≤ **0.025** →𝒏≥ 𝛂/𝟐 𝒏 **0.025**[𝟐] 

- **`# sample width to obtain ci of width <=0.05`** 

**`> z_alpha_2 <- qnorm(0.95) > z_alpha_2`** _A sample sized 1083 or more guarantees a 90% CI with a width_ **`[1] 1.644854`** _of 0.05,_ _**whatever the sample frequency of the extracted**_ 𝒏 _**sample is** (because we obtained based on the frequency to_ **`> (z_alpha_2*0.5/0.025)^2`** _which the maximum standard error corresponds)_ **`[1] 1082.217`**

## **Confidence interval for proportion/ CI width** 

𝛂 **Determination of the sample size needed to guarantee a CI for the proportion at level  1 – with a given margin of error, ME (or, equivalently, with a given width 2ME).** Using a conservative approach, for the margin of error to be at **most ME (or, equivalently for the width of the interval to be at most 2ME),** it is necessary to select a sample with size: 𝟐 𝒛 **0.5**[𝟐] 𝛂 𝟐 / 𝒏≥ **ME**[𝟐] 

Clearly the result should be rounded up to the next integer!

## **Confidence interval for the difference between means** 

As already seen with reference to point estimation, in many applications we are interested in comparing the means of two populations

**The parameter of interest is the difference between the means of the two populations,** 𝛍𝑿 −𝛍𝒀 In this case, the confidence interval will be built around the **unbiased** point estimator ( 𝑿−[ഥ] 𝒀[ഥ] ). The reliability factor and the standard error of the estimator depend on **the relationships between the samples and on the assumptions on the distributions of the populations.** 

**33** 

## **CI for difference between means, independent samples** 

In the case of **independent** samples, the sample means 𝑿[ഥ] and 𝒀[ഥ] are **independent** and thus **uncorrelated** : the **variance** of the estimator (𝑿−[ഥ] 𝒀)[ഥ] thus results: 

2 2 𝛔 𝛔 𝑋 𝑌 𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝑿−[ഥ] 𝒀[ഥ] ) = 𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝑿[ഥ] ) + 𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝒀[ഥ] ) = + 𝑛 𝑛 𝑋 𝑌 

Moreover, since 𝑿[ഥ] and 𝒀[ഥ] **are independent, in the case when** 

 The two populations 𝑿 and 𝒀 have normal **distribution** 

 **or** the samples are sufficiently large, so that the **central limit theorem** can be applied. one has that: 

**==> picture [370 x 23] intentionally omitted <==**

Following the same procedure as for building the confidence interval for the mean: 

2 2 𝛔 𝛔 𝑋 𝑌 = 𝒄𝒊 𝑿−[ഥ] 𝟏−𝛂 𝛍𝑿 −𝛍𝒀 (ഥ𝒙−ഥ𝒚) ∓𝒛𝛂/𝟐 (ഥ𝒙−ഥ𝒚) ∓𝒛𝛂/𝟐∙𝑺𝑬([ഥ] 𝒀) 𝑛𝑋[+] 𝑛𝑌[=] 

**34** 

## **CI for the difference between means, independent samples** 

**rare** . The case when both the variances are known is very 2 2 2  If the **unknown** variances are assumed to be **equal** , 𝛔𝑋 = 𝛔𝑌 = 𝛔 , the common variance is estimated using the so-called **pooled corrected sample variance:** 

**==> picture [693 x 100] intentionally omitted <==**

 If the **unknown** variances are assumed to be **different** , the standard error of (𝑿−[ഥ] 𝒀[ഥ] ) is 2 2 estimated by replacing 𝛔𝑋 and 𝛔𝑌 with the sample variances obtained from the two 𝟐 𝟐 samples, 𝑺𝑋 and 𝑺𝑌 . The confidence intervals built (under appropriate assumptions) in the two cases have different margins of error, due both (obviously) to different standard error estimates and to different reliability factors (percentiles). 

**35** 

## **CI for difference between means, independent samples** 

If 𝑿 and 𝒀 have **normal** distributions, and their variances are assumed to be **equal** : 

− − 𝑿−𝒀[ഥ] ([ഥ] ) (𝛍𝑿 𝛍𝒀) has a Student's _**t**_ distribution with ( 𝒏𝑿 + 𝒏𝒀 −𝟐) degrees of freedom. 𝟐 𝟐 𝑺 𝑺 𝒑𝒐𝒐𝒍𝒆𝒅 𝒑𝒐𝒐𝒍𝒆𝒅 ~~+~~ 𝒏𝑿 𝒏𝒀 

Thus, using the usual procedure, the confidence interval (estimate) is: 

**==> picture [501 x 75] intentionally omitted <==**

**==> picture [328 x 26] intentionally omitted <==**

_It can also be used without assuming normality if the samples are sufficiently large (_ _**same considerations on normal vs. Student's t as for** interval for non-normal population with unknown variance)!_ 

If 𝑿 and 𝒀 have **normal** distributions (or the samples **are** sufficiently large) with **different** variances, 𝟐 𝟐 the interval is built using the estimates 𝒔𝑋 and 𝒔𝑌 ; in this case, the reliability factor is still the percentile of a Student's _**t,**_ but with a different number of degrees of freedom (the interval in this case will only be obtained with R*)

## **Rstudio: CI.diffmean() for independent samples** 

The function **`CI.`** diffmean **`()`** in package **`UBStats`** allows to determine the confidence interval for the difference between means. In the case of **independent** samples, intervals can be built in two alternative ways 

## **Samples contained in two separate vectors** 

**`CI.diffmean(x, y, type="independent", sigma.x=NULL, sigma.y=NULL, conf.level=0.95, digits=2, data)`** where: 

- : name of two **numeric** **`date.`** The function 

- **`x,y`** vectors possibly names of two variables in determines the CI for **`μ_x-μ_y`** 

- **`type="independent"`** : specifies that the samples are independent (default) and not paired (case where **`type="paired"`** must be indicated, as we shall see later) 

- **`sigma.x,sigma.y:`** allow standard deviations to be specified, if **known** ; in the case of known and equal variances, it is sufficient to specify only one of the two arguments 

- **`conf_level`** is the confidence level (0.95 by default) 

- **`digits`** is the number of decimals used to round off the reported statistics 

_Note: the function does not check whether the conditions necessary for the determination of the interval (e.g. sample size, type of samples, paired or independent) are fulfilled_

## **Rstudio: CI.diffmean() for independent samples** 

The function **`CI.`** diffmean **`()`** in package **`UBStats`** allows to determine the confidence interval for the difference between means. In the case of **independent** samples, intervals can be built in two alternative ways 

## **Samples obtained based on a 2-level vector** 

```
    CI.diffmean(x, by, type="independent", sigma.by=NULL,
```

- **`conf.level=0.95, digits=2, data)`** where: 

- **`x,by`** : vectors of **equal length** ordered in such a way that their elements refer to the same unit **;** **`x`** is the name of a **numeric** vector **while** **`by`** is the name of a vector **that takes only two values,** **`by1`** ≺ **`by2`** (considering standard, alphabetical, numeric or order of levels in a factor); possibly **`x`** and/or **`by`** can be the names of variables in **`date.`** The function determines the CI for **`μ_by1-μ_by2`** 

- **`type="independent"`** : specifies that samples are independent (default) 

- **`x`** 

- **`sigma.by:`** vector containing the standard deviations in the two groups [see manual*]. 

- **`conf_level`** is the confidence level (0.95 by default) 

- **`digits`** is the number of decimals used to round off the reported statistics 

- _Note: the function does not check whether the conditions necessary for determining the interval (e.g. sample width, type of samples - paired or independent) are met_ 

* In the case of known variances we suggest using the **`x,y`** approach

## **CI for difference between means, paired samples** 

In the case of **paired samples** of size 𝒏 , two measurements 𝑿𝑖 and 𝒀𝑖 are available for each sample unit; the differences 𝑫𝑖 = 𝑿𝑖 −𝒀𝑖 can therefore be considered as measurements on the r.v. 𝑫= 𝑿−𝒀 on 𝒏 sample units. 

In this case, the variance of the sample mean of the differences, 𝑫[ഥ] **=** 𝑿−[ഥ] 𝒀[ഥ] is: ഥ 2 𝑉𝑎𝑟 𝛔 𝑫= 𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝑫)/𝒏= 𝐷 /𝒏 2 2 = 𝑉𝑎𝑟 𝑿+ 𝑉𝑎𝑟 𝒀−2𝐶𝑜𝑣 𝛔 +𝛔 −2𝛔 𝑿−𝒀/𝒏= [𝑉𝑎𝑟 𝑿, 𝒀] /𝒏= [ 𝑋 𝑌 𝑋𝑌] /𝒏 𝑿 e 𝒀 are Assuming that **jointly normal** (or that the **sample size is sufficiently large** ), the statistic 𝑫[ഥ] has a **normal** distribution **and** the confidence interval for is 𝛍𝑿 −𝛍𝒀 = 𝒄𝒊 ഥ𝒅∓𝒛 ∙𝛔 𝒏= ഥ𝒅∓𝒛 𝟏−𝛂 𝛍𝑿 −𝛍𝒀 𝛂/𝟐 𝑫/ 𝛂/𝟐 ∙𝑺𝑬(ഥ𝑫) where 𝒅[ഥ] **=** ഥ𝒙−ഥ𝒚 is the sample mean of the realisations of the differences 𝒅1, … , 𝒅𝒏 

**46** 

## **CI for difference between means, paired samples** 

The variance of the differences (and/or the variances of the two populations and their covariance) is seldom known, and the variance of 𝑫[ഥ] **=** 𝑿−[ഥ] 𝒀[ഥ] must be estimated - as we have seen when dealing with point estimation - with the **corrected sample variance:** 

**==> picture [341 x 67] intentionally omitted <==**

Since 𝑫[ഥ] is a sample mean, in the case of a **normal** distribution, the confidence interval for ( 𝛍𝑿 −𝛍𝒀 ) is obtained exactly as the interval for the mean of a normal population with unknown variance: 

**==> picture [585 x 28] intentionally omitted <==**

If the population is not normal, but the sample is large enough, so that the central linit theorem applies, it is possible to use the interval based on the percentile of the standard normal or on the percentile of the Student’s distribution, in order to account for the 2 𝛔 uncertainty associated with the estimate of 𝐷

## **Rstudio: CI.diffmean() for paired samples** 

The function **`CI.`** diffmean **`()`** in package **`UBStats`** allows to determine the confidence interval for the difference between means of **paired** samples, with the following syntax: 

```
    CI.diffmean(x, y, type="paired", sigma.d=NULL, conf.level=0.95,
digits=2, date)
```

## where: 

- : name of two **numeric** vectors ordered so that their elements refer to the same unit or names 

- **`x,y`** of two numeric columns in the dataframe specified in **`date`** 

- **`type="paired"`** : specifies that the samples are paired 

- **`sigma.d:`** allows the standard deviation of the **difference** to be specified, if **known** 

- **`conf_level`** is the confidence level (0.95 by default) 

- **`digits`** is the number of decimals used to round off the reported statistics 

_Remark: the function does not check whether the conditions necessary for determining the interval (e.g. sample width, type of samples - paired or independent) are met_

As already seen with reference to point estimation, in many applications we are interested in comparing the proportions of a certain phenomenon in two populations 

**Population 1** 

**Population 2** 

𝑿1, … , 𝑿𝒏𝑿 sample of size 𝒏𝑿 , iid 𝒀1, … , 𝒀𝒏𝒀 sample of  size 𝒏𝒀 iid 𝑿 distributed according to a Bernoulli of 𝒀 distributed according to a Bernoulli parameter 𝒑𝑿 (i.e. 𝑿 takes on a value of 1 parameter 𝒑𝒀 (i.e. 𝒀 takes on a value of 1 or 0 or 0 depending on whether a success is depending on whether a success is observed = observed or not, and 𝒑𝑿 proportion of or not, and 𝒑𝒀 = proportion of successes in the successes in the population), with population), with 𝐸 𝑿= 𝒑𝑿 and 𝑉𝑎𝑟 𝑿= 𝒑𝑿(𝟏− 𝒑𝑿 ) 𝐸 𝒀= 𝒑𝒀 and 𝑉𝑎𝑟 𝒀= 𝒑𝒀(𝟏− 𝒑𝒀 ) ෡𝑷𝑿 = (𝑿1+ … + 𝑿𝒏𝑿)/𝒏𝑿 **= sample** 𝑷෡𝒀 = (𝒀1+ … + 𝒀𝒏𝒀)/𝒏𝒀 = **sample proportion of successes proportion of successes** 

**The parameter of interest is the difference between the proportions in the two populations,** 𝒑𝑿 −𝒑𝒀

## **Confidence interval for the difference between proportions** 

The point estimator for the difference between the proportions in two populations is the −[෡] difference between the proportions in the two samples, 𝑷[෡] 𝑿 𝑷𝒀 In the case of **independent samples,** we have seen that:

−[෡] 𝑷 𝑷 is **never** _and_ 𝑉𝑎𝑟([෡] 𝑿 𝒀 ) known (it depends on 𝒑𝑿 𝒑𝒀 ), but it can be estimated by replacing 𝒑𝑿 and 𝒑𝒀 with the observed sample proportions. 

**If the samples are large enough, by the central limit theorem we have:**

## **Rstudio: CI.diffprop() for independent samples** 

The function **`CI.diffprop()`** in package **`UBStats`** allows to determine the confidence interval for the difference between the proportions of ‘successes' in two independent populations. Again, it is possible to use the syntax based on two vectors **`x,y`** or the syntax based on **a vector** **`x`** partitioned on the **basis of a 2-level vector** **`by`** . In the **first case** : 

```
CI.diffprop(x, y, success.x=NULL, success.y=NULL,
```

```
                         conf.level=0.95, digits=2,data)
```

## where: 

- : name of two vectors or factors or two variables in **`data`** : the interval is built for 

- **`x,y p_x-p_y`** 

- define the values of **`x`** and to be taken as success in the two 

- **`success.x,success.y: y`** samples. They can be omitted (in one or both cases) if **`x`** or **`y`** are binary (values 0/1; in this case it is assumed that 1 indicates a success) or logical (values **`TRUE/FALSE`** ; in this case it is assumed that **`TRUE`** indicates a success). If success is encoded in the same way in the two samples, it is sufficient to specify only one of the two arguments 

- **`conf_level`** is the confidence level (0.95 by default) 

- **`digits`** is the number of decimals used to round off the reported statistics 

_Note that the function does not check whether the conditions necessary for determining the interval (e.g. sample width) are satisfied_

## **Rstudio: CI.diffprop() for independent samples** 

The function **`CI.diffprop()`** in package **`UBStats`** allows to determine the confidence interval for the difference between the proportions of 'successes' in two independent populations. 

**In the case of vector** **`x` partitioned on the basis of a 2-level vector** **`by` :** 

**`CI.diffprop(x, by, success.x=NULL, conf.level=0.95, digits=2,data)`** where: 

- **`x,by`** : vectors (or factors) with the same length ordered so that their elements refer to the same unit. **`x`** is the name of a vector/factor, **`by`** is the name of a two-level vector/factor with two values/levels **`by1`** ≺ **`by2`** (possibly **`x`** and/or **`by`** can be the names of variables in **`data`** ). In this case, the function calculates the interval for **`p_by1-p_by2`** 

- **`success.x:`** defines the values of **`x`** to be taken as success. It can be omitted when **`x`** is binary 

- (values 0/1; in this case, 1 is assumed to indicate success) or logical (values **`TRUE/FALSE`** ; in this case, **`TRUE`** is assumed to indicate success). 

- **`conf_level`** is the confidence level (0.95 by default) 

- **`digits`** is the number of decimals used to round off the reported statistics 

_Note that the function does not check whether the conditions necessary for determining the interval (e.g. sample width) are satisfied_

## **Hands on: difference between proportions** 

The dataframe **`Banner`** (in **`Lesson 14-16_Data.Rdata)`** contains information on two alternative banners (A and B) shown to users of a social network. It is of interest to compare the Click-Through Rate (CTR) of the two banners, i.e. the ratio between the number of clicks on each banner and the number of banner views served by the ad server (impressions). The variable **`Click`** indicates for each user who viewed a banner whether they clicked ( **`Yes)`** or not ( **`No`** ). **Build a 90% confidence interval for the difference between the CTRs** 

```
# syntax x,y
# define data vectors
banner_A<-Banner$Click[Banner$Banner=="A"]
banner_B<-Banner$Click[Banner$Banner=="B"]
```

```
CI.diffprop(x=banner_A,y=banner_B,success.x="Yes",
conf.level=0.90,digits=4)
```

```
# syntax x,by
```

```
CI.diffprop(x=Click,y=Banner,success.x="Yes",conf.level=0.90,
digits=4,data=Banner)
```

- _In the case of unknown variance(s) for large samples the approximation is_ _**normal** , but one can_ 

_use Student's_ _**t** to widen the interval and thus account for the uncertainty associated with estimating the variance(s)_
